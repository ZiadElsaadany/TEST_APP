                    "Human factors: Human activities clearly contribute to climate change through human use of fossil fuels in their various forms in their activities, as the combustion of fossil fuels leads to the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which leads to a change in the atmosphere such as the amount of aerosols. Atmospheric particles suspended in the air and clouds. [8] Both greenhouse gases and aerosols affect the Earth’s energy imbalance through their effect on the change in the proportion of solar and infrared radiation entering and leaving the atmosphere, and the difference in the properties of gases and molecules, which leads to a rise in the degree of Earth's temperature.[8] The following are some of the main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity:[9] Increased concentration of architectural carbon dioxide, a major source of significant carbon dioxide emission. High methane concentration in the atmosphere due to many factors, including: It comes: intestinal fermentation of animals. Methods of manure management. Cultivation of rice fields. Change in land use methods and change in ground moisture. Effects of pipelines. Poor ventilation in landfills. High concentration of nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide due to various agricultural activities, including the use of fertilizers. The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in many fields, including: fire suppression systems. Manufacturing processes. Use in addition to halons in cooling systems. Natural factors Global warming is a complex phenomenon. It results from the interaction between human causes and a group of natural factors, and the rise in average temperature at the present time is a result of the interaction between them, and among the natural factors are the following. Volcanoes are considered one of the factors that contribute to the formation of the phenomenon of global warming, as the occurrence of volcanic eruptions over millions of years led to the emission of large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide.[11] It is worth noting that a single volcanic eruption has no effect. On the phenomenon of global warming, but these effects result from the occurrence of many volcanoes during the history of the Earth. When studying the impact of all those volcanoes since the formation of the Earth, the effect of volcanoes in increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere becomes clear, and thus its effect on the phenomenon of global warming. [11] Activity Solar: Changes in solar activity and activities related to it, such as flares and sunspots, affect the change in global temperature. For example, the seventeenth century was characterized by a climatic period called the Little Ice Age, the formation of which at that time was explained by the fact that the sun had little activity and its rays were faint. The average global temperature is about one degree Celsius lower than it is now.[10] Scientists have noticed the presence of a number of solar changes that affect global warming, which are as follows: a periodic change in solar activity, such as a change in the sunspot cycle, which extends to a year. The change in magnetic activity inside the sun, which affects solar activity, due to its main role in dispersing cosmic rays consisting of charged particles on the Earth. The magnetic field may collapse when the sun’s rays become dim, which works for cosmic rays to penetrate the solar system more deeply, then larger numbers enter. From those cosmic rays penetrating the Earth's atmosphere. Then the charged particles of cosmic rays are ionized in the form of small particles of dew, which begin to gather together to form water droplets, which in turn work to form clouds. If low clouds with a high thickness are formed, they work to reflect the energy of the sun into space, so the repeated formation of a cloud cover with those This method will lead, over time, to a change in the average global temperature. Changes in wavelengths such as visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. Melting of Permafrost The melting of ice in both the North and South Poles contributes on a large scale to the phenomenon of global warming due to the presence of large amounts of carbon stored in the ice. After the melting of that ice due to many factors such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and solar activity, gases are released on a large scale. When carbon is emitted suddenly, it will cause a disruption in various natural processes such as the carbon cycle, as the source of carbon stored in ice has been from outside the atmosphere for thousands of years. [10] Forest fires Forest fires affect the average global temperature, especially those that occur On a large scale and over long periods, as burning plants leads to the emission of carbon stored in plants, thus increasing the proportion of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These gases, in addition to solar radiation, play a major role in raising the temperature of the atmosphere and polluting the air. The effects of global warming The effects of global warming on health The phenomenon of global warming or greenhouse effect affects the health of living organisms, and an example of this is as follows: [12] The outbreak of harmful infections and the severe cholera epidemic in some types of seafood; Due to the rising temperature of surface waters such as oceans. The bodies' ability to resist viruses and infectious infections decreases due to the failure of agricultural crops and the spread of famine. The spread of kidney stone disease resulting from dehydration. Studies have shown an increase in the rates of infection with this disease since 1994 AD, after the rate was one person out of 20 people. The rate has now become one person out of 11 people, and if the temperature of the Earth continues to rise from It is expected that the number of infections will increase. The high summer temperature and its prolonged duration lead to the spread of many diseases caused by mosquitoes."

                    " There are many SolutionEs that can be implemented in order to reduce the phenomenon of global warming, including: enhancing the efficiency of energy use, as the energy systems used in heating and cooling buildings have the largest role in the phenomenon of global warming, and therefore energy efficiency makes it possible to use a smaller amount and obtain on the same production and services, which helps in saving energy and money. Improving the transportation sector The transportation sector leads to large emissions of gases, and these emissions have increased rapidly over the past decade, so these emissions should be reduced by following the following: Improving the efficiency of all means Transportation. Transitioning to low-carbon fuels. Using more efficient mass transportation systems. Producing a smart generation of cars that helps reduce gas emissions. Gradually getting rid of electricity produced from fossil fuels. This is done through a number of basic measures, which are: stopping coal factories and... Starting with the oldest and most polluting factories. Preventing the establishment of power plants that rely on burning coal. Applying advanced technology in capturing carbon emissions from power plants and storing them in the ground. The use of nuclear energy Nuclear energy helps reduce global warming because it releases small amounts of gases emitted from the global warming process, but in return it has serious effects on society, so it is important to discover nuclear energy more and search for SolutionEs to its problems. Developing new technology for using low-carbon fuels Developing and spreading awareness about low-carbon fuels helps reduce harmful emissions, can create new sources of energy such as algae and bacteria, and directs research on utilizing new materials technology for solar cells and batteries. Ensuring sustainable development: Each region of the world has a different impact on the problem of global warming and its ability to confront it. In general, all countries should cooperate to confront the problem, help poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change, and enhance their ability to switch to the use of low-carbon fuels. Forest Management and Agriculture It is important to preserve forests, avoid deforestation, limit their degradation, and produce food in more sustainable ways, in order to reduce emissions resulting from deforestation and agriculture. Modernizing renewable energy sources. Many studies have proven the ability of renewable energy, such as solar energy, bioenergy, and other forms of renewable energy to meet the majority of the world’s energy needs, in addition to its advantages in reducing pollution and its appropriate cost, so it is important to rely on it more. Reducing carbon dioxide by preserving the role of vital systems; Such as forests and oceans in doing their natural work as carbon sinks by ending the process of deforestation, encouraging continued agriculture, and avoiding habitat destruction within the oceans. Is there a benefit to global warming? Yes, there are some benefits to global warming, including; Reducing severe cold waves that lead to the death of people and animals, and the destruction of crops, and spring begins early, which benefits farm owners in providing warmth for crops. In addition, the presence of global warming opens the way in the Northwest Passage for greater time for maritime trade, due to the melting of Arctic ice."
